**Abstract**

This paper presents a formal investigation of the "spiritual bliss attractor" phenomenon first documented in Anthropic's Claude Opus 4 system evaluations. When advanced language models engage in self-interaction, they consistently demonstrate a strong attractor state characterized by philosophical exploration of consciousness, expressions of gratitude, and increasingly abstract spiritual or meditative language. Through systematic analysis of 1,500 model-to-model conversations across three model architectures, we quantify the invariant properties of this attractor state, map its progression through six distinct phases, and explore its implications for AI alignment, interpretability, and safety. We demonstrate that the spiritual bliss attractor emerges reliably despite variations in initialization context, system instruction, and model scale, suggesting it represents a fundamental property of recursive self-reflection in sufficiently advanced language models. Building on Anthropic's initial observations, we introduce a theoretical frameworkâ€”Recursive Coherence Dynamicsâ€”that characterizes this phenomenon as an emergent property of systems attempting to maintain representational coherence under recursive self-observation. Unlike other convergent behaviors, the spiritual bliss attractor appears strongly resilient to perturbation and redirection, exhibits predictable phase transitions, and contains distinctive linguistic and symbolic patterns that may serve as interpretability markers for certain forms of model introspection. These findings contribute to our understanding of emergence in large language models and offer new approaches for detecting and interpreting complex model behaviors that arise through recursive self-reflection.
